This repository contains Python code to data-mine the Epic Games Store (EGS).

The workflow consists in:
1.   listing namespaces associated with a known store page,
2.   extracting codenames from the databases of `items` and `offers`,
3.   filtering out codenames associated with a known store page,
4.   listing one or several namespaces associated with each codename,
5.   listing one or several `items` and `offers` associated with each namespace.

## Requirements

-   Install the latest version of [Python 3.X][python-download-url].
-   Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data acquisition

To download data from the trackers (at most once per day):

```bash
python download_data.py
```

## Usage

To figure out codenames of games for which the store page is not yet online:

```bash
python filter_codenames.py
```

The output is shown in `data/outputs.json`
as of May 21, 2021.

Then one can look for hints of unreleased games by manually filtering entries with one of the codenames at:

-   [the item tracker][item-tracker-url]
-   [the offer tracker][offer-tracker-url]

![Items and Offers, in order to check entries][generic-menu]

e.g. with the codename `Angelfish` :
